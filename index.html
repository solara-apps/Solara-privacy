        <li>Captured directly on your device</li>
        <li>Stored locally in your app's private storage</li>
        <li>Never uploaded to our servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Transcription</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Processed entirely on your device using OpenAI's Whisper Tiny model</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>3. AI Summaries & Insights (Optional Premium Features)</h3>

        <li>When you choose to summarize an entry, only the text transcript is sent to our AI service</li>
        <li>We use Claude AI models (Sonnet for premium users, Haiku for free users)</li>

        <li>No personal identifiers are included with requests</li>
